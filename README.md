# Debtclock

Simple Flask web app that displays the current US national debt using data from the U.S. Treasury API.
Currently very buggy
It works on my machine but not on my server lmao

## Running

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```python app.py```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
